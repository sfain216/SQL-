--- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
--- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
--- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

---Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

---Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

---Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

--What is the average danceability by artist and track?--
select 
artist_name,
track_name,
avg(danceability)
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by artist_name, track_name

--What are the top 10 most popular artists?--
select distinct
artist_name, popularity
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
order by popularity desc
limit 10

--What is the average tempo of the top 10 most popular songs?--
select
artist_name,
track_name,
avg(tempo)
from BIT_DB.spotifydata
group by artist_name, track_name
order by popularity desc
limit 10

--What is the average tempo of songs by popularity categories?--
select round(avg(tempo)),
case when popularity >= 90 then "most popular"
when popularity >=70 then "less popular"

--Using a CTE, calulate the average popularity for the artists. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show thier name, their average popularity, and label them as a "Top Star"--
with popularity_average_CTE as (
select s.artist_name, avg(s.popularity) as average_popularity
from spotifydata s
group by s.artist_name
)

select artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' as tag
from popularity_average_CTE
where average_popularity >= 90;
else "least popular" end as "popularity_tempo"
from BIT_DB.spotifydata
group by popularity_tempo;
